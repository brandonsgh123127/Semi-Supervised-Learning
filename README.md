# Semi-Supervised-Learning
## Purpose
Project is based on GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks), where one has a generator and discriminator.  Project goal is to upscale images of fruit from low quality, to an improved quality.
## Why?
In an effort to understand how GANs function, this code was created to mimic the functionality.  After working on this for a CS project, this gave a better understanding for usage of GANs.
